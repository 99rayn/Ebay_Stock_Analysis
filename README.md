# Ebay_Stock_Analysis

I've been working on an SQL-based stock analysis to explore eBay's historical performance. This project covers key insights like:

âœ… Stock Price Trends â€“ Highest and lowest prices over time
âœ… Volatility Analysis â€“ Identifying the most volatile trading periods
âœ… Trading Volume Trends â€“ Exploring correlations between volume and price movement
âœ… Peak Trading Days â€“ Finding the busiest trading days based on volume

ðŸ’¾ SQL Queries Used:
ðŸ”¹ Data filtering and aggregation
ðŸ”¹ Window functions for trend analysis
ðŸ”¹ Joins and subqueries for deeper insights



Would love to hear feedback from fellow data analysts! How do you approach stock data analysis with SQL? Drop your thoughts in the comments. ðŸ‘‡
